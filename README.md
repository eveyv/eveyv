### Every day, I have the same goal:

### I want to be a better developer tomorrow than I am today.
- There is always so much room to improve.

### Technologies:
- I am learning AWS and implementing it where I can; I hope to have my solution architect associate certification by 10//21.
- Currently, I prefer to work with a React front end when possible.
- I love to use Gatsby to create static websites.
- Express and Node.js as my preferred backend technologies but I am comfortable working in Ruby/Rails as well.
- PostgreSQL for my databases but I am excited to work on more projects using MongoDB.
- I'm looking forward to learning C#, particularly given my new preference to develop on Windows. 
- I use heroku to host but I am beginning to evaluate other options as solutions for clients when it makes sense.
- I love working with bash and I am trying to do my part to ensure I understand the technologies that I utilize but I know I have a long way to go with scripting. 

### When I am not working or learning new technologies, I like to keep busy by doing home improvements and chores (splitting firewood, gardening, food prep, landscaping), adventuring with Dutch, our dutch shepherd mix, playing with my toys in the garage ( weights / wood) and doing whatever else I can with my incredible girlfriend.
