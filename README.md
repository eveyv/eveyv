### Hi
### I just wants to be a better developer tomorrow than I am today.
### I took a leap of faith when I decided to change careers. When I first undertook this journey, I had no idea that I would be relocating from Boston to the Maine Highlands, moving twice along the way, but I knew that my passion for coding would help make being adaptable more achievable.
### Weeks before our move North, I spilled a large, steaming hot coffee on my <1 year old Macbook Air and immediatley ruined it.  I was too cocky and foolish to get the warranty on it and I was forced to get creative as a broke, aspiring developer.  This is where I happened upon the Dell G7 I am currently using.  Making the switch from a unix based system was definitely a lot at first but now I vastly prefer developing this way, particularly with the flexability to develop using Ubuntu via WSL2.
## Now that I am finally settled in, I am setting up my own effort called Seven North Website  Design in the hopes of using it to both grow my skillset, as well as utilize React.js to help modernize websites for small businesses and groups in my local community.

### Technologies
- I prefer to work with a React front end when possible
- I love to use Gatsby to create static websites.
- I use Express.js and Node.js as my preferred backend technologies but I am comfortable working in Ruby/Rails as well.
- I use PostgreSQL for my databases but I am excited to work on more projects using MongoDB
- I am very excited to begin learning C#, particularly given my new preference to develop on a Windows machine. 




### When I am not working on a project or learning a new technology, I like to spend my time splitting firewood, snowmobiling, walking our dog, or just being a blob with my girlfriend.
