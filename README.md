### Every day, I have the same goal:
### I want to be a better developer tomorrow than I am today.
### I took a leap of faith when I decided to change careers. When I first undertook this journey, I had no idea that I would be relocating from Boston to the Maine Highlands, moving twice along the way, but I knew that my passion for coding would help make being adaptable more achievable.
### Weeks before our second move north, I spilled a large, steaming hot coffee on my <1 year old Macbook Air and immediatley ruined it.  I was too cocky and foolish to get the warranty on it and I was forced to get creative as a broke, aspiring developer.  This is where I happened upon the Dell G7 I am currently using.  Making the switch from a unix based system was definitely a lot at first but now I vastly prefer working on Windows, especially given the flexibility to develop using Ubuntu via WSL2.
## Now that I am finally settled in, I am setting up my own effort called Seven North Website  Design in the hopes of using it to both grow my skillset, as well as utilize React.js to help modernize websites for small businesses and groups in my local community.

### I am seeking employment as a full-time software-engineer/full-stack developer/front or back end developer so that I can learn and grow in a supported environment. I stopped applying due to my uncertainty once I realized I would be moving to such a removed area but now that I am here, I am looking at in-person jobs in Bangor, as well as any remote jobs which I am qualified for.
> I want to acknowledge that I will unquestionably prioritize all salaried work for an employer over my solo-efforts.

### Technologies
- I prefer to work with a React front end when possible ( I'm very excited to learn more about React server components)
- I love to use Gatsby to create static websites.
- I use Express.js and Node.js as my preferred backend technologies but I am comfortable working in Ruby/Rails as well.
- I use PostgreSQL for my databases but I am excited to work on more projects using MongoDB
- I'm looking forward to learning C#, particularly given my new preference to develop on Windows. 
- I use heroku to host but I am beginning to evaluate other options as solutions for clients when it makes sense.
- I love working with bash and I am trying to do my part to ensure I understand the technologies that I utilize but I know I have a long way to go with scripting. 

### When I am not working on a project or learning a new technology, I like to spend my time splitting firewood, snowmobiling, walking our dog, or just being a blob with my girlfriend.
